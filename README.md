# Point-Cloud-Morphing-Idea
**PROOF OF CONCEPT CAUSE I'M NOT THE THREE.JS WIZARD**

Quick ideation of morphing between four distinct point clouds in Three.js to avoid rendering geo-nodes in Blender. To use this with your own point cloud data, you can replace the **createSeedGeometry()**, **createSproutGeometry()**, **createGrowthGeometry()**, and **createMatureGeometry()** methods with functions that load your actual point cloud data. The morphing system will automatically handle transitions between any four sets of point positions.
